Summer 2021 -
<br>
"I feel incredibly fortunate to be a part of The Louisiana Freshwater Sponge Project as the first computer science major. In this role, I am responsible for a variety of tasks including managing the project's website, operating drones, analyzing and managing data, and conducting fieldwork. Additionally, I assist with overseeing other aspects of the research project. My long-term objective is to obtain an Associate of Science (AS) degree in Computer Science and a Louisiana Transfer, Associate of Science (ASLT) degree with a focus on biological sciences from BRCC. Afterward, I plan to pursue a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Coastal Environmental Science with a specialization in data science and a minor in biological sciences at Louisiana State University."
